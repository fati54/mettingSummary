John: Good afternoon everyone, welcome to our weekly meeting. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that we have a guest speaker joining us today, Dr. Smith will be giving a presentation on the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

Jane: Great, thanks for the reminder John. Can we start by going over the agenda for today's meeting?

Bob: Sure, first on the agenda is the progress update on the new product launch. Jane, can you give us an update?

Jane: We're on track to launch next month. The design is finalized and we're in the process of finalizing the manufacturing. We are currently working on the testing phase to make sure that the product meet the standards before launching it.

Bob: Great. How about the marketing plan?

Jane: We're finalizing the details, but we're planning to launch a major ad campaign next month. We are planning to use multiple channels to reach our target audience and also, we're considering to use Influencers in our campaign.

John: And what about the budget?

Jane: We're still finalizing the budget, but it looks like we'll be able to stay within our target. We've been able to negotiate better prices from our suppliers, which has helped us to stay within budget.

Bob: That's good to hear. What's next on the agenda?

John: Next, we'll discuss the budget for next quarter. Bob, can you give us an update on that?

Bob: Sure. We're projecting a 5% increase in revenue next quarter, and we're planning to allocate more budget towards research and development. We are also planning to invest more in technology to improve our production process, which will help us to increase our efficiency and reduce costs.

John: Sounds good. Any other items for discussion?

Jane: No, that's it for today.

John: Okay, thanks everyone. Let's meet again next week. Dr. Smith, thank you for joining us today and giving us your valuable insights.

Bob: Thanks, see you next week.
